# Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on April 15, 2024 (UTC).
- **Impact:** The API service experienced downtime, affecting all users attempting to access the platform during the outage window. Approximately 75% of users were unable to perform essential actions, leading to a significant disruption in service.

## Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Due to an incorrect parameter configuration, the load balancer was unable to distribute incoming traffic evenly among the backend servers, leading to overloaded servers and eventual service degradation.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 AM (UTC):** The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in server response times.
- **10:05 AM (UTC):** Engineers investigated the issue and identified that the load balancer was not distributing traffic properly.
- **10:15 AM (UTC):** Initial assumptions suggested a possible issue with backend server performance, leading to a brief investigation into server health metrics.
- **10:30 AM (UTC):** After ruling out server performance issues, attention shifted back to the load balancer configuration.
- **10:45 AM (UTC):** The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation and resolution.
- **11:30 AM (UTC):** The root cause was confirmed to be a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
- **12:00 PM (UTC):** The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration and performing a rolling restart of affected services.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused traffic to be unevenly distributed among backend servers, leading to server overload and service degradation. To resolve the issue, engineers corrected the load balancer configuration to ensure proper traffic distribution. Additionally, a rolling restart of affected services was performed to restore normal operation.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated configuration validation checks for load balancer settings to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to provide early detection of load balancer issues.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Develop and implement a comprehensive load balancer configuration management process.
  - Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to identify and address any deviations from best practices.
  - Enhance documentation for load balancer configuration to ensure clarity and consistency in future modifications.

This incident highlighted the importance of robust configuration management practices and proactive monitoring in maintaining
